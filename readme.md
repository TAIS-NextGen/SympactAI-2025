SympactAI is an initiative that aims to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence research and real-world impact. The program highlights the idea that research in AI is not limited to purely theoretical work, but also includes applied, research-driven projects that address concrete challenges and generate meaningful outcomes.

**SympactAI 2025 Projects Overview:** 


| **Project** | **Mentors** | **Participants** | **Description** |
|------------|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **AI Driven Early Detection of Olive Tree Diseases Using Satellite Imagery** | Khalil Bendriss | Wajdi Kalthoum<br>Chaima Ben Rabah<br>Oumaima Werghemmi<br>Tasnim Assali<br>Nour Mlaiki | Olive farming is vital to Tunisia’s economy, but diseases cause 10–30% annual yield losses. Current detection methods rely on manual scouting, which is slow and expensive. Satellite-based AI could enable early intervention, reducing losses. A similar project was started and sponsored by Orange in 2022; their app no longer exists on app stores, but they could be contacted for feedback. |
| **Pump Watch – AI Driven Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Pump Stations** | Fedy Ben Hassouna<br>Mohamed Aziz Ben Dhiab | Aya Limem<br>Ikram Dridi<br>Ameni Ayedi<br>Mariem Daoud<br>Mariem Kammoun | Industrial pump stations are critical infrastructure in manufacturing, water treatment, and energy production. Unexpected failures cause downtime and high repair costs. This project uses AI-driven predictive analytics based on motor current monitoring and frequency-domain analysis to detect anomalies and predict failures early. The integration of *Pumpo*, an intelligent chatbot, provides real-time insights and maintenance recommendations. |
| **Building Unified Reasoning Paths via Sequence Merging** | Fadoua Khmaissia<br>Safa Messaoud | Aymen Lassoued<br>Nacef Mbarek<br>Bechir Dardouri<br>Eya Machraoui<br>Nesrine Taamallah<br>Takwa Ahmadi | In domains such as education and scientific communication, multiple reasoning paths can lead to the same conclusion. Merging these paths helps create clearer, more comprehensive explanations while reducing redundancy. This project focuses on designing and evaluating a method for merging reasoning sequences by aligning semantically similar steps while preserving logical coherence. |
| **Hands-On Reinforcement Learning for Stock Trading using FinRL** | Mahdi Kallel<br>Imen Ghazouani | Moez Kessemtini<br>Mazen Temani | Automated stock trading using AI and reinforcement learning is a growing field, but environment setup and data pipelines are often complex. This project leverages *FinRL*, an open-source library for financial RL, to simplify experimentation using ready-to-use datasets (e.g., historical Dow Jones 30 data), providing students with a practical and accessible entry point into AI-driven trading systems. |
