## Solo Winner - UmojaHack:

UmojaHack Africa, the continent's premier hackathon, offers $10,000 in prizes, engaging over 2,000 students from 300+ universities across 30 countries. Transitioning to a virtual format in 2020 and 2021, the 2022 event, enhanced by Zindi, aimed to broaden participation and amplify the collaborative experience, supported by major tech sponsors. I applied computer vision techniques to classify images of deep-sea invertebrates, focusing on species found off the coast of South Africa. Leveraging advanced algorithms and post-processing methods, I achieved an impressive accuracy rate of nearly 99%, showcasing the efficacy of the developed model in species classification.
