# About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Louisville in Computer Science and Engineering, working at the Knowledge Discovery and Web Mining Lab and advised by Dr. Olfa Nasraoui.

My research revolves around Recommender Systems, specifically, I am trying to investigate problems such as Bias, Fairness, and Interpretability in state of the art Recommender Systems Practices

## Research Interests

#### Machine Learning

As Machine Learning is taking over our daily activities leading to a large amount of Data being generated, I am interested in improving AI and ML algorithms. I am especially interested in Recommender Systems and its related topics

#### Bias, Fairness and Transparency in ML and AI

I am interested in investigating major flaws in ML algorithms related to Bias. For instance, I study feedback loop bias in Recommender Systems and their impact on both the user and the algorithm performance

[Debiased Explainable Pairwise Ranking from Implicit Feedback (Recsys2021)](https://www.samikhenissi.com/)

**Authors: Khalil Damak, Sami Khenissi, Olfa Nasraoui**

**Abstract:**

Recent work in recommender systems has emphasized the importance of fairness, with a particular interest in bias and transparency, in addition to predictive accuracy. In this paper, we focus on the state of the art pairwise ranking model, Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), which has previously been found to outperform pointwise models in predictive accuracy, while also being able to handle implicit feedback. Specifically, we address two limitations of BPR: (1) BPR is a black box model that does not explain its outputs, thus limiting the user’s trust in the recommendations, and the analyst’s ability to scrutinize a model’s outputs; and (2) BPR is vulnerable to exposure bias due to the data being Missing Not At Random (MNAR). This exposure bias usually translates into an unfairness against the least popular items because they risk being under-exposed by the recommender system. In this work, we first propose a novel explainable loss function and a corresponding Matrix Factorization-based model called Explainable Bayesian Personalized Ranking (EBPR) that generates recommendations along with item-based explanations. Then, we theoretically quantify additional exposure bias resulting from the explainability, and use it as a basis to propose an unbiased estimator for the ideal EBPR loss. The result is a ranking model that aptly captures both debiased and explainable user preferences. Finally, we perform an empirical study on three real-world datasets that demonstrate the advantages of our proposed models.

[Theoretical Modeling of the Iterative Properties of User Discovery in a Collaborative Filtering Recommender System. In Fourteenth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys ’20)](https://www.samikhenissi.com/)

**Authors:** Sami Khenissi, Mariem Boujelbene, Olfa Nasraoui

**Abstract:**

The closed feedback loop in recommender systems is a common setting that can lead to different types of biases. Several studies have dealt with these biases by designing methods to mitigate their effect on the recommendations. However, most existing studies do not consider the iterative behavior of the system where the closed feedback loop plays a crucial role in incorporating different biases into several parts of the recommendation steps.

We present a theoretical framework to model the asymptotic evolution of the different components of a recommender system operating within a feedback loop setting, and derive theoretical bounds and convergence properties on quantifiable measures of the user discovery and blind spots. We also validate our theoretical findings empirically using a real-life dataset and empirically test the efficiency of a basic exploration strategy within our theoretical framework.

[Debiasing the human-recommender system feedback loop in collaborative filtering. In Companion Proceedings of The 2019 World Wide Web Conference, 645-651](https://www.samikhenissi.com/)

**Authors:** Wenlong Sun, Sami Khenissi, Olfa Nasraoui, Patrick Shafto

**Abstract:** Recommender Systems (RSs) are widely used to help online users discover products, books, news, music, movies, courses, restaurants, etc. Because a traditional recommendation strategy always shows the most relevant items (thus with highest predicted rating), traditional RS’s are expected to make popular items become even more popular and non-popular items become even less popular which in turn further divides the haves (popular) from the have-nots (unpopular). Therefore, a major problem with RSs is that they may introduce biases affecting the exposure of items, thus creating a popularity divide of items during the feedback loop that occurs with users, and this may lead the RS to make increasingly biased recommendations over time. In this paper, we view the RS environment as a chain of events that are the result of interactions between users and the RS. Based on that, we propose several debiasing algorithms during this chain of events, and evaluate how these algorithms impact the predictive behavior of the RS, as well as trends in the popularity distribution of items over time. We also propose a novel blind-spot-aware matrix factorization (MF) algorithm to debias the RS. Results show that propensity matrix factorization achieved a certain level of debiasing of the RS while active learning combined with the propensity MF achieved a higher debiasing effect on recommendations.

As a part of the RET experience, I mentored a team of High School teachers through a 6-weeks program to help them with conducting research about Machine Learning. My responsibilities included providing python and programming courses, ML fundamentals, and guidance through the different project phases

Summer 2018:

\- The team I mentored worked on explainability and recommender systems. They understood the basic models for RS and they implemented a collaborative filtering recommender systems and also provided explanation with the predictions

Summer 2019:

\- I mentored two teams: The first team worked on explainable ML. They learned how to use explainability frameworks such as LIME with simple prediction tasks. The second team worked on Fairness in AI. They used the AI360 toolkit to investigate fairness for clustering algorithms on an income dataset.
