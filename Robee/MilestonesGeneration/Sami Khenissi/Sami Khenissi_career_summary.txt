Sami Khenissi is a highly accomplished Staff Research Scientist at Meta, based in the San Francisco Bay Area, with a focus on building scalable recommender systems that serve billions daily. Since 2022, he has been working on large language models (LLMs) at Meta, enhancing AI systems for internal coding tools. From 2022 to 2025, he served as the Tech Lead for Facebook Video Recommendations, concentrating on large-scale ranking and late-stage personalization models. Prior to Meta, Sami was a Research Assistant at the University of Louisville from April 2017 to June 2022, where he engaged in theoretical modeling of feedback loops in recommender systems, with his work accepted at Recsys 2020. He also explored interpretability for deep learning architectures and countered exposure bias in matrix factorization, earning a 1st place award at the 2019 Speed Research Exposition Master Category. Additionally, he designed an explainable active learning strategy for recommender systems. In 2021, he completed a research internship at Bloomberg LP in New York, collaborating with the AI-Recommendations team. Sami holds a PhD in Computer Science (2019-2022) and a Master of Science in Computer Science (2018-2019) from the University of Louisville, as well as a degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from Tunisia Polytechnic School (2014-2017). He is proficient in French, English, and Arabic, and his expertise includes machine learning, Python, and recommender systems, with a strong background in query understanding, query expansion, information retrieval, Solr, NLP, and ranking. Sami has been recognized with the University of Louisville Doctoral Fellowship, the Graduate Dean’s Citation, and the Tunisian Excellence Scholarship, and he has published works on user discovery in collaborative filtering and debiasing human-recommender system feedback loops.
